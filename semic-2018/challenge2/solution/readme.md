The solution for this challenge was a bit... Foolish.

After a long search and a lot of confussion (mind that we were told that
we had to write an algorithm to solve the problem) we found out that this
is a very well known problem called **Partition (number theory)**.

From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_(number_theory)) we
discovered that, for example *p(10000)* is approximately $3.6*10^106$ .
