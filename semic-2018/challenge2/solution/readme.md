The solution for this challenge was a bit... Foolish.

After a long search and a lot of confussion (mind that we were told that
we had to write an algorithm to solve the problem) we found out that this
is a very well known problem called **Partition (number theory)**.

From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_(number_theory)) we
discovered that, for example *p(10000)* is approximately 3.6\*10^106.

Remember that we are looking for *p(10000000)* so the solution for that
gotta be a really big number. 

After that discover we had to possibilies:

* We can write an algorithm with big numbers to calculate that

* We can find a way of aproximating it
