## Soultion

This was a really easy problem. We just wrote an C++ program to do it.
In this challenge efficiency was not evaluated but creativity yes.

So we wrote a recursive algotihm as it was easy and clean to do.

The only problem we encountered with this problem is to know when to stop
counting. We were suspecting to be when the number is less than a 100. 
Later on we got confirmed by the organization that this was the case.

You can check solution.cc for our final code.
